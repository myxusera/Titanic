# Titanic EDA 

This is a kaggle kernel that I wrote for Titanic dataset.

When she was launched, the RMS Titanic was largest moving object ever built – 269 metres long and weighing 46,000 tons. One of three Olympic class ocean liners operated by the White Star Line, she was built between 1909–11 by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. On 10 April 1912, the Titanic departed on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York.

On 14 April 1912, despite warnings of ice fields, the ship did not reduce speed and struck an iceberg shortly before midnight. The iceberg ripped a long gash in the side and the ship began to flood. Passengers were unaware and joked about the ice found on the deck. The Captain ordered the lifeboats to be filled and lowered, with women and children first. More than two hours after hitting the iceberg, Titanic sank into the Atlantic Ocean.
